# FARE - The Free Architecture for Remote Education
This is the main codebase for FARE. 

## What
This repository contains a Drupal module, called FARE, which is a composition
of tools and functionalities for remote education. 
Each functionality is developed in a separate module in order to be easily
tested and deployed. 

## How To 
Check the dependencies if you install manually. 
If using `drush` it should clear the Drupal dependencies.
However, some dependencies have to be installed locally by means of composer,
see the `composer.json` file.
